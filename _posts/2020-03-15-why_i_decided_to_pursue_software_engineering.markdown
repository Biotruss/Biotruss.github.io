#### A Spark of Curiosity

     It started with a spark of curiosity about how computers work. This is mostly in part to the friend I’ve made in my life. I’m sure we’ve all had those friends who were really into technology that seem to just know everything about most of the new phones, computers, televisions and whatever else under the scope of technology. 
     
     We found it exciting because in high school it seemed technology was evolving faster than we could keep up. There was always something to talk about whether it’s an update for our phones or a new expensive pc part that we all wanted!


     
#### The First Person to Introduce Me to Software Engineering

     The first time I was introduced to software engineering I was admittedly very discouraged. I didn’t understand the first thing that was on the page. 
     
     A friend of mine was just trying to modify a game on his pc to allow a specific mod, but the code was preventing the download from applying to the game. It’s not like he knew exactly what he was doing either as he was just following a video, but after I saw that the changes he made actually worked in the game my mind was blown. I was convinced that he broke the game and that it would need to be completely uninstalled and reinstalled to fix, but it actually worked. 
     
     It seemed like magic at the time, but it helped me see that software engineering works and it's a tool that people can use.


     
#### Doing Something I’m Interested In

     I’ve had a few jobs over the years that would fall under the scope of food, service, and maintenance. I didn’t find myself disliking the positions that I took, but I did find myself thinking that I want a little more out of life. 
     
     I wanted a career that I am interested in so I’ll have that much more to look forward to waking up every morning. The way I saw it is that if I was going to spend so much of my time in a career I might as well spend time on making a career that I’m interested in. 


     
#### Believing In Myself

     Software Engineering interests me because I like a challenge. I’ve read that taking on software engineering would mean a lifestyle change and requires that someone be willing to learn new things everyday to take on those new challenges. I am ready to nurture and monopolize my curiosity for technology to learn everything I can about the tools I'll need to pursue a new career in software engineering! So I've enrolled in Flatiron's program in order to jumpstart my education! Wish me luck!
